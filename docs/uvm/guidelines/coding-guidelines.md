# UVM Coding Guidelines

This UVM Coding Guidelines are heavily influenced by:

- [Easier UVM Coding Guidelines](https://www.doulos.com/media/1277/easier-uvm-coding-guidelines-2016-06-24.pdf)
- [Verification Academy - UVM Coding Guidelines](https://verificationacademy.com/cookbook/uvm-universal-verification-methodology/uvm-guidelines/)
